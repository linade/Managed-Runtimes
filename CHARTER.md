# RISC-V Working Groups: Managed-Runtimes Charter

## Scope
- Advance, promote, and enable managed-runtime technologies on the RISC-V architecture. Targets include, but are not limited to, JVM, WebAssembly, V8, etc.
- Arrange and coordinate collaboration between the various related developer communities. The SIG provides a common place for these communities to share information and discuss common issues.
- Collaborate with RISC-V extension Task Groups(e.g., J Extension, Memory Model) to assess the impact of their proposals on managed-runtime technologies and to make proposals of our own based on our knowledge and analysis of managed-runtimes.

## Goals
- Provide support to enable members to produce production-ready JDK builds for RISC-V.
- Build benchmark/application suites for performance measurement of managed-runtimes, and use these to publish and track performance comparisons with other architectures, especially ARM.
- Define and produce managed-runtime and hardware co-optimization proposals, with a focus on, but not limited to, just-in-time compilation, garbage collection, and memory model optimization
